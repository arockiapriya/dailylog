Mutable Def:
Mutable objects can change their value but keep their id().
list :Not hashable; mutable.

Immutable Def:
An object with a fixed value. Immutable objects include numbers, strings and
tuples. Such an object cannot be altered. A new object has to be created if
a different value has to be stored. They play an important role in places where
a constant hash value is needed, for example as a key in a dictionary.

tuple :immutable; hashable if all its members are hashable

Hashable Def:

An object is hashable if it has a hash value which never changes during
its lifetime (it needs a hash()method), and can be compared to other objects
(it needs an eq() method). Hashable objects which compare equal must have
the same hash value.

set : An unordered collection of unique values. Items must be hashable.
dict : An unordered collection of unique key-value pairs; keys must be hashable.

Examples of immutable Data Types:
int , long , float , complex
str
bytes
tuple
frozenset
Examples of mutable Data Types:
bytearray
list
set
dict
